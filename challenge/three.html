      <h4>Update:</h4>
      <p>Today I simply started the <em>Data Structures: Objects and Arrays</em> chapter from <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/" target="_blank">Eloquent JavaScript</a>.</p>
      <p>I didn't quite get to the exercises. This chapter is a doozy! I may have to re-read it. If anybody has read this book and can maybe answer a couple of questions I have, that'd be great!</p>
