      <h4>Update:</h4>
      <p>Yesterday, I altered the codes so that the output would appear on this site. It was good because it was a little extra practice, but instead of spending time reading <em>Eloquent JavaScript</em> and practicing the fundamentals of JavaScript, I was spending more time on HTML.</p>
      <p>So, today I decided to start putting my work on the exercises on codepen.io.</p>
